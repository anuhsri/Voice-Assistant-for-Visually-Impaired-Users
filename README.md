# Python-Virtual-Assistant
As we know Python is a suitable language for scriptwriters and developers. Let’s 
write a script for Voice Assistant using Python. The query for the assistant can 
be manipulated as per the user’s need. 
Speech recognition is the process of converting audio into text. This is 
commonly used in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc. Python provides an API 
called SpeechRecognition to allow us to convert audio into text for further 
processing. In this article, we will look at converting large or long audio files 
into text using the SpeechRecognition API in python.
